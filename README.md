# Comparison of predictive power of historical and news for stock market movement

This project is for my exam in machine learning which is part of my Masters in Data science and computational intelligence at Coventry University.
The python code is also published as a Kaggle notebook [(HERE)](https://www.kaggle.com/dklepl/nlp-for-stock-market-prediction-2).

**If you like this project I'd be happy for some stars here on GitHub and upvotes on the Kaggle noteboook :) **
